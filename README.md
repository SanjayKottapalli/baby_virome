# Baby Virome

A small virome analysis pipeline. The Baby Virome pipeline performs a BLASTp search against the Phage SEED database and will gather taxonomic and functional profiles for a viral metagenome (virome). The input for the pipeline are peptide open reading frames (ORFs) with abundance information in the header.
